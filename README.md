## Staging Your Changes

1. Once you have completed your work and before you push your changes back to **GitHub**, you will need to first **stage** the file that you have changed which is **lab6.php**. If you modified any of the others files thatn make sure that these files also get staged.
2. In **Visual Studio Code** you should see a **1** next to the **Source Control** icon in the sidebar.
3. Click on the **Source Control** icon.
4. You will then see the letter **M** next to the **lab5.php** file. This means that the file has been modified.
5. Hover your mouse over **lab6.php** and you will see a **+** symbol appear.
6. Click on the **+** symbol. This will add your file to the **Git staging area**.
7. Now where you see the text box above you should see an area where you can type a message.
8. Enter the text **Lab No. 6 Submission**.
9. Click the **check mark**. This will **commit** your changes.
10. You are now ready to push your changes back to **GitHub**.
11. To push your work to **GitHub** bring up the **VS Code command palette** (Control+Shift+P on PC and Command+Shift+P on Mac).
12. Enter **git push** and then press enter.
13. Your work will then get magically sent back to **GitHub**.
14. To check to see if your changes made it to **GitHub**, go to the URL of your repository and enter it into your browser. You will find this URL in the assignment. Click on it and it will take you to a page where you can find your **repo URL**.
15. You will then be brought to your repository. Click one on the lab5.php file to see if your code is there.
